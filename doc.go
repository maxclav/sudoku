// sudoku is a package that provide functions to generate, validate, solve and print a board (grid).

// From Wikipedia:
// Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle.
// In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 x 9 grid with digits
// so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 x 3 subgrids
// that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
// The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
